"What is Python?","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.","Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum.|Python supports multiple programming paradigms including OOP and functional programming.|Python is known for its simple and readable syntax.|Python is widely used in data science, web development, and automation.","Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.|Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.|Python emphasizes code readability with significant whitespace.|Python supports procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming paradigms.","basic_knowledge"
"How does async/await work in Python?","Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code in Python. The 'async' keyword defines a coroutine function, and 'await' pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.","Async/await in Python allows for asynchronous programming using coroutines.|The async keyword defines a coroutine function that can be paused and resumed.|The await keyword pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes.|Async/await enables concurrent execution without blocking the main thread.|Python's asyncio library provides the event loop for async operations.","Async/await is Python's syntax for writing asynchronous code.|The async keyword marks a function as a coroutine.|The await keyword yields control back to the event loop.|Coroutines allow other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations.|This pattern is essential for efficient handling of concurrent operations.","advanced_concepts"
"What is the difference between a list and a tuple?","Lists are mutable sequences that can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses ().","Lists are mutable data structures in Python that can be modified after creation.|Tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created.|Lists use square brackets [] for definition.|Tuples use parentheses () for definition.|Lists have methods like append, remove, and extend.|Tuples are more memory-efficient than lists.","Lists are mutable sequences in Python, meaning elements can be added, removed, or changed.|Tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be modified after creation.|Lists are defined using square brackets [].|Tuples are defined using parentheses ().|The immutability of tuples makes them hashable and usable as dictionary keys.","data_structures"
