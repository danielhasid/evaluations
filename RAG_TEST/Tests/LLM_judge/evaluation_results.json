    "question": "How does async/await work in Python?",
    "generated_answer": "Async/await in Python is a technique for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax. It is part of the asyncio library in Python which is used for writing single-threaded concurrent code using coroutines, multiplexing I/O access over sockets and other resources, running network clients and servers, and other related primitives.\n\nThe \"async\" keyword before a function defines it as a \"coroutine\" function, which means it can be paused and resumed, allowing other code to run during the pauses. It's a special kind of function which is able to \"yield\" control, generally back to an event loop.\n\nThe \"await\" keyword is used in an async function to wait for the result of another coroutine function or task. It essentially signifies where a program will give control back to the event loop, which can then execute other code before resuming this function.\n\nAsync/await allows for concurrent execution of code, which can lead to significant performance improvements in I/O bound programs. However, it doesn't run tasks in parallel and doesn't provide any speed improvements for CPU-bound tasks.",
    "expected_answer": "Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code in Python. The 'async' keyword defines a coroutine function, and 'await' pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple?",
    "generated_answer": "A list is mutable, meaning you can change its content without changing its identity. You can modify, add, remove, or rearrange items in a list after it has been created. A tuple, on the other hand, is immutable, meaning you can't change it at all after it's been created. This immutability can be useful when you need a constant set of values and you want to ensure they do not get changed accidentally.",
    "expected_answer": "Lists are mutable sequences that can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses ().",
