    "question": "How does async/await work in Python?",
    "generated_answer": "Async/await in Python is a way to write concurrent code using the `asyncio` library. `async` is used to define a function as a coroutine, which is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing other code to run during the wait times. `await` is used within these coroutines to call other coroutines and wait for them to finish. This allows Python to handle other tasks in the meantime, such as managing IO operations or user input, which leads to more efficient use of resources in programs with a lot of waiting, like web servers or user interfaces.",
    "expected_answer": "Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code in Python. The 'async' keyword defines a coroutine function, and 'await' pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple?",
    "generated_answer": "A list is mutable, meaning you can modify its content. A tuple, on the other hand, is immutable meaning you cannot change its content once it's defined. This is the main difference, but there are also other differences such as lists having more built-in functions than tuples.",
    "expected_answer": "Lists are mutable sequences that can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses ().",
