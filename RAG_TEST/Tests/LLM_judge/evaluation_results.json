    "question": "How does async/await work in Python?",
    "generated_answer": "Async/await in Python is used for asynchronous programming, allowing for the execution of multiple tasks concurrently, without the need for multi-threading or multi-processing. \"Async\" is used to declare a function as a coroutine, which can be paused and resumed, enabling other tasks to run during the pause. \"Await\" is used inside these coroutines to call other coroutines, effectively pausing the current coroutine until the awaited one finishes. This allows Python to handle other tasks in the meantime, increasing efficiency in programs that involve IO-bound tasks, like making requests to a server or reading from a file.",
    "expected_answer": "Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code in Python. The 'async' keyword defines a coroutine function, and 'await' pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple?",
    "generated_answer": "A list is mutable, meaning you can change its content by adding, removing, or changing elements. A tuple, on the other hand, is immutable, meaning that once it's defined, you can't change its content. This immutability makes tuples slightly more efficient in terms of memory and performance than lists.",
    "expected_answer": "Lists are mutable sequences that can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses ().",
