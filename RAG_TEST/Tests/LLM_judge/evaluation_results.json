      "question": "How does async/await work in Python?",
      "generated_answer": "Async/await in Python is a method of handling asynchronous programming, which allows for concurrent execution of tasks without the need for multi-threading. \n\nThe 'async' keyword is used to define a function as a coroutine. This means that the function will be non-blocking and it can be stopped in the middle of execution, allowing other tasks to run.\n\nThe 'await' keyword can only be used inside an 'async' function and is used before a function call to indicate that the function should be awaited, i.e., the program will pause and wait for that function to complete before moving on.\n\nThis system allows Python to handle IO-bound and high-latency operations more efficiently, as it can switch to other tasks while waiting for a response. It's particularly useful in applications like web scraping, API calls, and other IO-bound tasks. \n\nHowever, async/await does not natively support CPU-bound tasks, as Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecodes at a time, even on multi-core CPUs. \n\nTo handle CPU-bound tasks, you would need to use multi-processing or offload the computation to a C-extension that releases the GIL.",
