    "question": "What is Python?",

It supports multiple programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.",

    "question": "How does async/await work in Python?",
    "generated_answer": "Async/await in Python is a method of handling asynchronous operations, which allows for concurrent execution of tasks without the need for multi-threading or multi-processing. 'async' is a keyword used to define a coroutine function, which is a special kind of function designed to be used with asynchronous operations. 'await' is used inside the coroutine function to suspend the execution of the function until the awaited task is complete. This allows other tasks to run during the waiting period, improving the efficiency of the program.",
    "expected_answer": "Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code in Python. The 'async' keyword defines a coroutine function, and 'await' pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.",

It adds some extra context about not needing multi-threading or multi-processing and describes efficiency improvements, which are not present in the Expected Output. The explanation is accurate and addresses the input, but the inclusion of additional information slightly reduces alignment with the evaluation steps.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple?",
    "generated_answer": "A list and a tuple are both types of data structures in Python that can store multiple items. The main difference between them is that lists are mutable, which means you can change their content without changing their identity. You can modify, add, remove, or reorder items in a list. On the other hand, tuples are immutable, which means you can't change them at all once they are created. This immutability makes tuples slightly more efficient to use in Python than lists when you have a constant set of values.",
    "expected_answer": "Lists are mutable sequences that can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses ().",

However, it omits the detail about the syntax difference (square brackets for lists, parentheses for tuples) present in the Expected Output, and introduces an extra claim about tuples being more efficient, which is not in the Expected Output. Thus, while the main requirement is addressed, there are minor shortcomings in completeness and adherence.",
