    "question": "How does async/await work in Python?",
    "generated_answer": "Async/await in Python is a method used for handling asynchronous programming, which allows for performing multiple operations at once without waiting for each operation to complete. 'Async' is a keyword for defining a function as a coroutine, which is a special function that can have its execution paused and resumed. 'Await' is used to call these coroutines and pause the execution of the function until the awaited coroutine is complete.\n\nThis allows Python to handle other tasks in the meantime, which can significantly improve efficiency in programs that involve I/O-bound tasks (like network requests or file reading/writing), where waiting for completion of each task would otherwise cause a lot of idle time. This does not, however, speed up CPU-bound tasks, as Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecodes at a time.",
    "expected_answer": "Async/await is a pattern for writing asynchronous code in Python. The 'async' keyword defines a coroutine function, and 'await' pauses execution until the awaited coroutine completes, allowing other tasks to run concurrently.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple?",
    "generated_answer": "A list is a mutable data type in Python, meaning it can be changed after it is created. It is defined by values separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets. A tuple, on the other hand, is an immutable data type, meaning it cannot be changed after it is created. It is defined by values separated by commas and enclosed within parentheses.",
    "expected_answer": "Lists are mutable sequences that can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable sequences that cannot be changed once created. Lists use square brackets [] and tuples use parentheses ().",
