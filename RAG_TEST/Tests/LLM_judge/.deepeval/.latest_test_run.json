'Async' is a keyword for defining a function as a coroutine, which is a special function that can have its execution paused and resumed. 'Await' is used to call these coroutines and pause the execution of the function until the awaited coroutine is complete.\n\nThis allows Python to handle other tasks in the meantime, which can significantly improve efficiency in programs that involve I/O-bound tasks (like network requests or file reading/writing), where waiting for completion of each task would otherwise cause a lot of idle time.
