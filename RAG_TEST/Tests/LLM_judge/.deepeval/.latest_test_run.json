This doesn't block the entire program like a normal function call would. Instead, it only pauses the current coroutine, allowing other coroutines to run in the meantime.\n\nThe async/await syntax is a part of the asyncio library in Python 3.5 and above, which provides a framework for handling asynchronous I/O, among other things.
