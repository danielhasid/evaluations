It's a special kind of function which is able to \"yield\" control, generally back to an event loop.\n\nThe \"await\" keyword is used in an async function to wait for the result of another coroutine function or task. It essentially signifies where a program will give control back to the event loop, which can then execute other code before resuming this function.\n\nAsync/await allows for concurrent execution of code, which can lead to significant performance improvements in I/O bound programs.
